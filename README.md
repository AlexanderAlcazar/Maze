# Maze

This repository contains the code for a maze-solving project, originally provided as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course.

## Description

The project is designed to demonstrate key data structures — specifically stacks and queues — and their use in algorithms often applied to maze traversal and solving. Most of the codebase was provided as starter code for the course.

## Your Contributions

The following components were fully implemented by Alexander Alcazar:

- **stack.h**: Stack Abstract Data Type using a linked list.
- **queue.h**: Queue Abstract Data Type using a linked list.
- **update() in player.cpp**: The algorithm or logic provided for the Player's update functionality.

All other files and project structure were provided as part of the course materials.

## File Overview

- `stack.h`: Implementation of a stack using a doubly linked list.
- `queue.h`: Implementation of a queue using a doubly linked list.
- `src/player.cpp`: Contains the update() function related to player movement/logic.
- Other files: Provided by the course and not modified.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlexanderAlcazar/Maze.git
    cd Maze
    ```

2. Build and run instructions will depend on your environment and course setup. Generally, with a `Makefile`:
    ```bash
    make
    ./maze
    ```

3. For further details, refer to provided course instructions or comments in the code.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Standard build tools (e.g., make)

## Credits

- **Alexander Alcazar** - Implemented stack.h, queue.h, and update() in player.cpp.
- Remaining code and structure provided by the course instructors.

## License

This project was completed as coursework and is intended for educational purposes.
